## Abstract
In the current digital era, advertising has grown to be both commonplace and essential, and companies are always looking for ways to maximize the impact of their online advertising campaigns. This abstract presents
a novel method for achieving this objective by applying machine learning techniques. Through the prediction of two crucial metrics—Click-Through Rates (CTR) and Conversion Rates—this initiative seeks to provide marketers
with insightful data regarding the effectiveness of their ads. Sophisticated machine learning models can predict the chance that a person
will click on an advertisement and then convert it by analyzing past data.By utilizing algorithms like neural networks, decision trees, and 
regression models, this predictive framework guarantees that advertising campaigns are customized to target the most responsive demographic.
