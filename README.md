## Abstract
In the current digital era, advertising has grown to be both commonplace and essential, and companies are always looking for ways to maximize the impact of their online advertising campaigns. This abstract presents a novel method for achieving this objective by applying machine learning techniques. Through the prediction of two crucial metrics—**Click-Through Rates (CTR)** and **Conversion Rates**—this initiative seeks to provide marketers with insightful data regarding the effectiveness of their ads. Sophisticated machine learning models can predict the chance that a person will click on an advertisement and then convert it by analyzing past data. By utilizing algorithms like decision trees, classification models, this predictive framework guarantees that advertising campaigns are customized to target the most responsive demographic.


## Problem Statement
Businesses often struggle to determine the effectiveness of their advertisements, leading to inefficient marketing spending. This project aims to address this issue by developing a machine-learning model capable of predicting ad performance. By analyzing historical data and relevant features, the model will forecast metrics like click-through rates (CTR) or conversion rates. The goal is to provide businesses with actionable insights to optimize their ad campaigns and improve marketing ROI.
The effectiveness of particular advertisements has a significant influence on public relations overall. According to the research, simply raising someone’s awareness of certain goods, events, and brands increases the likelihood that they will buy those goods, attend those events, or support those brands. Additionally, a man’s odds of making a direct item commitment greatly increase if an advertisement manages to capture his consideration regarding the extent to which he or she has a prompt, good response to it.
